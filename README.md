# Dotfiles machine configuration script

Before starting, make sure the latest version of Xcode is installed and run at least once (to install command-line tools) from the Mac App Store.

## Setup Git Keys

This is only required for a brand new machine, and is used to authenticate your computer with your GitHub account.

Create the key in the default directory:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "Computer Name"
```

When it asks for a password, press enter for no password.

Copy the key to the clipboard:

```bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Then go to Account Settings in GitHub and add this key to your account.

Full instructions for the above steps can be referenced from https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys.

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Vortec4800/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./bootstrap.sh
```

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```

This will automatically pull any changes and update your machine.
